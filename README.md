# GenAI Portfolio

This repository showcases my projects and learning from the **GenAI Data and Analytics Academy Specialization Certificate**.  
It demonstrates hands-on experience and concepts in Generative AI, including foundation models, prompt engineering, RAG systems, AI agents, and production-level model deployment.

## Specialization Courses Covered

1. **GenAI Foundations**  
   - Core principles of Generative AI  
   - Basic projects and experiments with LLMs

2. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - Designing effective prompts for LLMs  
   - Optimizing output for specific use cases

3. **GenAI Data Engineering and RAG Systems**  
   - Building data pipelines for AI  
   - Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems

4. **GenAI Foundations and AI Agents Development**  
   - Designing autonomous AI agents  
   - Multi-step reasoning and task automation

5. **GenAI Model Development and Production Engineering**  
   - Fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific applications  
   - Deploying and monitoring AI systems in production

## How to Use This Repository
